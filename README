Quirinus
========================
Quirinus is a C++ library created to provide some basic types and functions
similar to some script languages.

Base types:
  Object: base type, parent for any other type.
  Bool: boolean type, which may be true or false.
  Int: multiple precision integer using GMP library.
  Float: multiple precision float using MPFR library.
  Bytes: byte string, providing all necessary functions.
  Unicode: unicode string, providing all necessary functions.

Encoding support:
  Support for the most popular encodings (including Unicode encodings).
  Support for 8, 16 and 32-bit character sets.
    char: same as in ANSI C; sign of char is meanless.
    wchar_t: depends on size in bits; if 4, then the same as unicode.
    bytechar: same as uint8_t type, provided just for compatibility.
    widechar: same as uint16_t type, can be used for wchar_t emulation.
    unicode: same as uint32_t type, used to store Unicode characters.
  Each has its std::vector typedef (charstack, wcharstack, bytecharstack,
  widecharstack, unicodestack); std::string and std::wstring containers are not
  used due to poor multithreading support in some libraries.

Mathematical library:
  Support for the functions available from GMP and MPFR libraries.

Regular expressions:
  Support for the regular expressions using PCRE library.

Quirinus
========================
Quirinus is a C++ library created to provide some basic types and functions
similar to some script languages in combination with C++ speed and features.

Base types:
  Object: base type, parent for any other type.
  Bool: boolean type, which may be true or false.
  Int: multiple precision integer using GMP library.
  Float: multiple precision float using MPFR library.
  Bytes: byte string, providing all necessary string functions.
  Unicode: unicode string, providing all necessary string functions.

Encoding support:
  Support for the most popular encodings (including Unicode encodings).
  Support for 8, 16 and 32-bit character sets.
    char: same as in ANSI C; sign of char is meanless.
    wchar_t: depends on size in bits; if 4, then the same as unicode.
    bytechar: 8-bit unsigned character type, may be used with UTF-8.
    widechar: 16-bit unsigned character type, may be used with UTF-16.
    unicode: 32-bit unsigned character type, may be used with UTF-32.

Mathematical library:
  Support for the functions available from GMP and MPFR libraries.

Regular expressions:
  Support for the regular expressions using PCRE library.
